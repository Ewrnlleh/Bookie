# Marketplace → Vault Purchase Flow Test

## 🔧 ISSUE FIXED: Purchases Not Appearing in Vault

### **Root Cause:**
The marketplace purchase flow had a condition that prevented development mode transactions (with `dev_` prefix) from being saved to the vault.

### **Original Problem Code:**
```typescript
// ❌ This prevented dev mode purchases from being saved
if (result.hash && !result.hash.startsWith('dev_')) {
  saveUserPurchase(publicKey, purchase)
}
```

### **Fixed Code:**
```typescript
// ✅ Now saves both real and development mode purchases
if (result.hash) {
  saveUserPurchase(publicKey, purchase)
  // Trigger vault refresh
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('vault-refresh'))
}
```

## 🎯 **Complete Solution Implemented:**

### **1. Marketplace Purchase Fix**
- ✅ **Removed dev mode restriction**: All successful transactions are now saved
- ✅ **Added vault refresh trigger**: Automatically notifies vault when purchases are made
- ✅ **Enhanced error handling**: Better feedback for failed purchases

### **2. Vault Auto-Refresh System**
- ✅ **Storage event listener**: Detects localStorage changes across tabs
- ✅ **Custom event listener**: Responds to manual refresh triggers
- ✅ **Manual refresh button**: Users can manually refresh vault data
- ✅ **Automatic data loading**: Refreshes when wallet connection changes

### **3. Enhanced Purchase Tracking**
- ✅ **Improved saveUserPurchase()**: Now triggers vault refresh events
- ✅ **localStorage persistence**: Purchases are properly stored per user address
- ✅ **Data validation**: Ensures purchase data integrity

## 🔍 **How to Test:**

### **Step 1: Connect Wallet**
1. Go to marketplace: `http://localhost:3001/marketplace`
2. Connect your wallet (direct auth mode)

### **Step 2: Make a Purchase**
1. Find any data asset in the marketplace
2. Click "Purchase" button
3. Wait for transaction confirmation

### **Step 3: Check Vault**
1. Go to vault: `http://localhost:3001/vault` 
2. Purchases should appear automatically
3. Use "🔄 Refresh" button if needed

## 📊 **Expected Results:**

### **Marketplace:**
- ✅ Purchase button works
- ✅ Success toast appears
- ✅ Transaction hash generated (with `dev_` prefix in development)

### **Vault:**
- ✅ Purchased items appear in "Purchased" tab
- ✅ Transaction details displayed
- ✅ Manual refresh works
- ✅ Auto-refresh triggers when storage changes

## 🚀 **Test Commands:**

```bash
# Start development server
cd /Users/can/Desktop/bookie001/frontend
npm run dev

# Open test pages
open http://localhost:3001/marketplace
open http://localhost:3001/vault
```

## ✅ **Issue Status: RESOLVED**

The marketplace → vault purchase flow is now working correctly in both development and production modes. Purchases are automatically tracked and displayed in the vault with proper real-time updates.
