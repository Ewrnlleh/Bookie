## 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Simplified Architecture:**
```
📁 frontend/
├── 📁 app/
│   ├── page.tsx              # Landing page
│   ├── marketplace/page.tsx  # Data marketplace
│   ├── sell/page.tsx         # Upload data
│   └── vault/page.tsx        # User dashboard
├── 📁 components/
│   ├── header.tsx            # Navigation
│   └── simple-wallet-connect.tsx  # Wallet connection
├── 📁 lib/
│   └── simple-wallet-context.tsx  # Wallet state

    └── simple-soroban.ts     # Blockchain interaction
```
